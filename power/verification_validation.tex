\section{Verification and Validation}
Most of the requirements which we had been set from the initial planning phase were met in one way or another but there were some that were unable to be fully tested due to time restraints.  
The power of the new motors was tested and they met the forecast power and were in fact a little faster than anticipated at full speed.  This was probably due to the estimated voltages of 12V being used when in fact the batteries were operating at 12.8V.  Likewise, the batteries performed equally well, lasting as long as expected.
In this respect both components were verified and met our requirements.  
\newline
The validation however was harder to test as the vehicle was never able to be utilised at full power for a prolonged time.  This meant we were unable to systematically test the longevity of batteries and power management on a full scale mission with all functions operational.  Possible explanations for this were the time constraints in getting all the required components ready for proper testing and it was also possible that our targets for the project were a little ambitious.
