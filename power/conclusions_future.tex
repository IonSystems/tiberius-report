\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

\subsection{Standalone battery monitoring system and battery protection}
Currently the battery monitoring can only sense the power being used and turn off some of the devices using relays. In the future it would be better to have a system that could turn off the outputs from the batteries to protect them from over discharge.

\subsection{Power Management} The power management could be further improved to include statistical analysis and even artificial intelligence to better predict battery usage, control of sensors, actuators and efficiency of network devices.

\subsection{Extra batteries for longer runtime}
The module holding the batteries could be replicated and stacked to hold even more batteries, giving Tiberius a longer mission lifetime.

\subsection{Power supply}
One of the many ideas proposed was to have a power cable that could be plugged into Tiberius for use in the lab without needing to constantly recharge the batteries. This has taken form as a long cable that currently only powers the electronics. However this could be split to power the motors as well, preferably with a smaller power supply.

\subsection{On-board battery charging}
In addition to the power supply it makes sense that when Tiberius was plugged in with the power cable then the batteries should be charged at the same time using an on-board charger.
