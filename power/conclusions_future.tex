\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\subsection{Standalone battery monitoring system and battery protection}
Currently the battery monitoring can only sense the power being used and turn off some of the devices using relays. In the future it would be better to have a system that could turn off the outputs from the batteries to protect them from over discharge.
\subsection{Power Management} The power management could be further improved to include statistical analysis and even artificial intelligence to better predict battery usage, control of sensors, actuators and efficiency of network devices.
\subsection{Power Supply}
Further improvements to the power supply (ie batteries) could be made in future iterations.  The module holding the batteries could be replicated and stacked to hold even more batteries, giving Tiberius a longer mission lifetime.
