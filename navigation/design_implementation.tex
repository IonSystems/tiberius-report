\section{Design and Implementation}
Once decisions where made about which types of navigation would be used for \gls{tiberius3} and that there would need to be a difference between indoor and outdoor navigation, the following systems where designed. After the design process was complete some of the systems where implemented in order to demonstrate some of the navigation options available to \gls{tiberius3}. 
\subsection{Point to Point Algorithm}
\label{sec:nav_design_p2p} %This needs to stay, Cam ref section this from web
As a starting point for the outdoor navigation systems of \gls{tiberius3}, a base movement algorithm was created this was called Point to Point. The purpose of this was to allow tiberius the ability to move from the current location that the robot would be in, to a given destination using a direct, effectively straight, path. The path is created using equations found on \ref{latlongpoints}, these where then converted to python in order to be used within tiberius' control system. The Equations used to create the point to point algorithm were as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Distance, where the distance between the two locations is calculated.
\item Bearing, Where the heading that the robot needs to be facing/travelling in is determined.

\end{itemize}
