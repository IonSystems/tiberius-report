\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

\subsection{Conclusion}
Navigation is a key component within the creation of any autonomous robot, with \gls{tiberius3} there has been a focus on getting outdoor navigation working, with less time spent on the indoor navigation systems that would be required in order to fully autonomies.
\newline
Many of the sensors that operate to help navigation can be used indoors and outdoors however others such as the \gls{GPS} cannot. The downside is that most of the algorithms created during the project have been centred around the \gls{GPS}. Sensors like the kinect and \gls{LIDAR} could provide more efficiency with an indoor navigation system, therefore \gls{tiberius3} bas the technologies to successfully navigate an indoor environment, if required by future projects.
\subsection{Future Development}
With the current iteration of the tiberius project complete, there was a chance to reflect some on areas that could be improved in later projects as well as opportunities to further advance the robot in terms of navigation. within this final navigation section there will be a run-down of things that the current group believe could make for the next steps in the development of \gls{tiberius3}.
