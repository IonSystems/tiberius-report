\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

\subsection{Conclusion}
Navigation is a key component within the creation of any autonomous robot, with \gls{tiberius3} there has been a focus on getting outdoor navigation working, with less time spent on the indoor navigation systems that would be required in order to full autonomies.

\subsection{Future Development}
With the current iteration of the tiberius project complete, there was a chance to reflect some on areas that could be improved in later projects as well as opportunities to further advance the robot in terms of navigation. within this final navigation section there will be a run-down of things that the current group believe could make for the next steps in the development of \gls{tiberius3}.
