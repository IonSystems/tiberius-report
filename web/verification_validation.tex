\section{Verification and Validation}

\subsection{Unit Testing}


\subsection{Portability}
Portability in the context of software defines how well software will respond to be used on a variety of platforms. In the context of this project, we are particularly concerned on how compatible our software will be across all current Raspberry Pi platforms, as well as future releases.

We have implemented a setup script that makes a few decisions based on the detected Raspberry Pi version and operating system, so ensure only compatible software is installed. This enables a high level of portability among current Raspberry Pi versions, but makes no effort to install a working system on any other device.

\subsection{Usability Testing}
Internal usability tests were carried out to ensure the web interface was intuitive to use, by students familiar with basic robotics concepts. %TODO! maybe
