\section{Verification and Validation}



\subsection{Portability}
Portability in the context of software defines how well software will respond to be used on a variety of platforms. In the context of this project, we are particularly concerned on how compatible our software will be across all current Raspberry Pi platforms, as well as future releases.

We have implemented a setup script that makes a few decisions based on the detected Raspberry Pi version and operating system, so ensure only compatible software is installed. This enables a high level of portability among current Raspberry Pi versions, but makes no effort to install a working system on any other device.

% \subsection{Usability Testing}
% Internal usability tests were carried out to ensure the web interface was intuitive to use, by students familiar with basic robotics concepts. %TODO! maybe

\subsection{Requirements Satisfaction}
Making reference to the requirements set up in the Preliminary Design Review\cite{tibby-lit-review}, the following requirements have not been satisfied (see Table \ref{tab:web_requirements_verification}). A justification for each unimplemented requirement is also included in Table \ref{tab:web_requirements_verification}.

The requirement satisfaction percentage has been calculated as 82\%. This figure has been calculated based on the 6 unimplemented requirements, out of the total of 33 requirements. This figure is approximate, some features were not initialled defined. All requirements are not made equal.

\textbf{Requirement Code} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Justification}   \\ \hline

% Start of requirement
R 18 (g) &
Missions should not be shared with other users. &
Support for multiple users is supported, but all missions and tasks are global. For our use case, we had no reason to restrict access to missions.
\\ \hline
%---------------------
% Start of requirement
R 18 (j) &
Missions should not be able to be edited during a live mission. &
Missions can be edited during a live mission, but the live mission remains unaffected, this is because all mission data is sent all at one at the beginning of the mission. This functionality was deemed suitable.
\\ \hline
%---------------------
% Start of requirement
R 19 (b) &
The estimated time until completion should be displayed to the user. &
No implementation of time monitoring has been done, so no indication of time until completion is available.
This requirement would be useful, but not essential. More time would allow this feature to come to life.
\\ \hline
%---------------------
% Start of requirement
R 19 (c) \& (d) &
The number of completed tasks should be displayed to the user. \&
The number of task remaining should be displayed to the user.&
The framework is in place to allow the web interface to count tasks, but there was not enough demand for these features to be implemented.
\\ \hline
%---------------------
% Start of requirement
R 22 &
The web interface must display live data from Tiberius.&
This requirement has been partially fulfilled, motor and arm status is provided. No sensor data is displayed live to the user.
