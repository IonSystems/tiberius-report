\subsection{Software used}
\subsubsection{OpenWRT router software}
OpenWRT is an open-source linux distrubution for embedded devices, typically wireless routers.
\subsubsection{SoftEther VPN Bridge}
SoftEther VPN Bridge is software that allows you to cascade-connect to a Virtual Hub of a SoftEther VPN Server operating at a remote location and create a Layer-2 bridge connection between that VPN connection and a physical network adapter on a computer running SoftEther VPN Bridge. SoftEther VPN Bridge is the ideal software for a computer connected to a remote base LAN when you want to connect the remote base LAN to a VPN configured with SoftEther VPN Server (namely, a Virtual Hub on a SoftEther VPN Server).
