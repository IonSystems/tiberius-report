\subsection{database}

\subsubsection{Creating database}
The database is checked to see if it already exists. If it does it is deleted (dropped). It is then created with the unique row described in the next subsections. 

\subsubsection{Ultrasonics}
insert image of database in every chapter


\subsubsection{LIDAR}
Lidar data read using SDK (C++)
Changed the output to return a JSON format
Python dictionary in this format...
Small error with the last comma breaking the JSON object so used python data.replace(',\n' , ']') which replaced the last comma with a ]

Lidar class validates the data
 - removes data (angle) which is obscured by the antenna
 
 insert id, start flag, angle, distance ,reading_iteration, timestamp
