\subsection{Hardware available for debug}
Due to the complexity of the different systems at work on Tiberius, it made sense to have some way of visualizing what was going on without the need to have a monitor plugged in.
\newline
It was decided to make use of a NeoPixel ring and strip to give some way to show data in the system, and the status of each module.
\newline
Currently there is an 8 NeoPixel strip and a 24 NeoPixel ring connected to the External Hardware Controller. As with the other external hardware devices these rings can be set using serial commands.

\subsection{Current use for diagnostics hardware}
Currently the led strip is used to show the validity of sensor data at a glance and the ring is used to show the direction of North and the direction of the next way-point.
\subsection{Future ideas}
In the future the ring could be used to visualize what Tiberius can see around itself.
