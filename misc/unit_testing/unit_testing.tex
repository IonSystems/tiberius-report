\section{Unit Testing}

During development in semester one, unit tests were created for the database wrapper class, as well as some control functions. All unit tests can be found on Github, in the \texttt{testing} module. These tests are automatically ran after every commit, by Travis \gls{CI}.

Travis \gls{CI} is triggered with each commit, and runs \texttt{setup.py} and runs all unit tests. The results are then posted to our Github repository, so developers can spot bugs.
