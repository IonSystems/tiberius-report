\section{Logging}

\subsection{Justification}
During development, it is important to be able to understand exactly what the system is doing. This is especially useful when debugging. 

\subsection{Implementation}
A consistent logging format that indicates the source of the message, with various logging levels was developed using Python's logging package.

All messages are stored in a log file, allowing developers to look back at a sequence of events.
