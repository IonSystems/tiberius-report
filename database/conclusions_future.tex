\subsection{Dedicated database Pi}
Since polyhedra uses an in-memory database, it is required to run on a system with sufficient RAM. Currently the database and all the control software is being run on the same raspberry pi, which leaves limited RAM for the database when all the control software is running. Future work measure the RAM usage and analyse the effect on the database.
