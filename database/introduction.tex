\subsection{Introduction}
The database was completely redesigned from previous years in terms of the schema, and how our Python code interfaces with the database.

A highly extendable database wrapper was written in Python, and support for SQLite and Polyhedra was included. The design of this wrapper makes incorporating new database engines - other than SQLite and Polyhedra - extremely easy.

A layer of abstraction is created to separate the developer from the raw SQL statements, but also allowing controller access to raw SQL statements when no other option is available.

A comparison of two possible interactions with the database are given below:

\begin{lstlisting}
def query_sensor_validity(poly):
    return poly.query(
        SensorValidityTable.table_name,
        [
            'ultrasonics',
            'compass',
            'gps'
        ]
    )
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
return poly.sql("SELECT ultrasonics, compass, gps from sensor_validity_table;")
\end{lstlisting}

As well as creating a layer of abstraction to aid database development and integration, database interaction also take place behind the scenes, thanks to Python decorators.
