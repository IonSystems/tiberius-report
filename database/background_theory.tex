\subsection{Messaging pattern}
A messaging pattern defines how different components in system communicate with each other.

\subsubsection{Publish and subscript}
sensors publish
different programs subscribe separately

\subsubsection{Database}
A database is central location in which information is stored \cite{databasedefinition}. The most prevalent approach is the relational database. A relational database is a collection of data items organized as a set of formally described tables, which can be accessed or manipulated \cite{relationaldatabasedefinition}.

\subsection{Types of database}

\subsubsection{SQL}

\subsubsection{Polyhedra}
The benefit polyhedra holds over other database's namely SQL in this case is that it is an in-memory database. This means it can handle a high throughput and has a very short access time. Tiberius is a real time robot, which means it actions must occur with out a noticeable delay. 

Polyhedra uses TCP/IP for communication between modules and SQL for data access; because data access uses SQL it makes it easier for the development team to debug problems since some of the development team already had experience working with MySQL which uses the same commands.
