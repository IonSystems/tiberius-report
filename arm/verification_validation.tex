\section{Verification and Validation}
\subsection{Testing of the arm}
The arm was tested with several different objects including, several water bottles, spools of wire and a ball. It had difficulty gripping a full water bottle as it slipped out of the gripper.

The arm was tested with a maximum weight of 2Kg although it could probably lift an object at least twice as heavy with some minor improvements to the rigidity of the A-frame at the base.
\subsection{Safety testing}
The inbuilt safety functions were tested and successfully stopped the arm from moving to invalid locations or joint angles. However they did not stop the arm from hitting external objects since this could not be planned for ahead of time. A possible solution to this would be using the Kinect 2 data to see when the arm was going to hit something.
