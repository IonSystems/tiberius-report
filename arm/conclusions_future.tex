\subsection{More Degrees of Freedom} 3rd joint could be added to the robotic arm to give a further degree of freedom and would allow a greater reach for the arm and greater dexterity.  This would be fairly straightforward to implement and could be added on to the current arm with minimal change.  Another feature for updating could be allowing the armâ€™s gripper to be controlled by motors instead of gravity, allowing it to pick up objects from different angles and orientations.
