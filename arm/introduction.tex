\subsection{Previous arm}
Picture of previous arm

Previously Tiberius had a small arm, it could only lift about a kilogram and was very short, too short to reach the ground if mounted on Tiberius III.

\subsubsection{Hardware}
In light of the problems of the old arm it was decided that a new arm would be designed that could lift a reasonably heavy object of about 2KG from the ground in front of Tiberius and store it in a basket on the side of the robot.

The arm also had to be able to keep position without requiring power which required the use of worm drives for all joints. This would stop the arm from flailing around when not in use, since it would be a huge waste of power to keep it powered all the time. Additionally the use of worm drives gives a very large gear ratio with a simple design so makes the arm easier to design.
